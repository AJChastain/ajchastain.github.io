            <h2>April is Distracted Driving Awareness Month</h2>
            <p><em>The Turlock Police Department encourages drivers to give the phone a break and focus on the road.</em><br><br>

                Throughout the month of April, the Turlock Police Department will have additional officers on patrol specifically looking for drivers who violate the state’s hands-free cell phone law.<br><br>
                
                Lieutenant Steve Rodrigues said, “When you are driving, give the phone a rest. A driver’s number one focus should be on the road. Anything that distracts you from the task of driving, especially a phone, puts yourself and others at risk.”<br><br>
                
                According to the 2020 California Statewide Public Opinion Survey, more than 75% of surveyed drivers listed “Distracted Driving because of TEXTING” as their biggest safety concern.<br><br>
                
                “Not driving distracted is a simple but significant behavior change. The goal is to increase compliance with the hands-free cell phone law and keep people safe,” said Sergeant David Hall.<br><br>
                
                Under current law, drivers are not allowed to hold a phone or other electronic device while behind the wheel. Drivers under 18 year old are not allowed to use a phone for any reason, including hands-free.
                If you need to make a call or send a text, pull over and park at a safe location. Drivers should silence their phones or put the phone out of reach, such as the glove box or trunk.<br><br>
                
                Funding for this program was provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.<br><br>
                
                The Turlock Police Department is an active participant in the Crime Stoppers Program. Callers can leave an anonymous tip by calling Crime Stoppers at (209) 521-4636 and may be eligible for a cash reward.<br><br>

            <h2>Turlock was founded on 22 December 1871 by John William Mitchell,</h2>
            <p> who was a successful grain farmer. The
                city began with just a few buildings, including a post office and a grain warehouse. Mitchell and his
                brother eventually owned more than 100K acres, stetching from Keyes to Atwater. In the early 1900s,
                their property was sold by 20-acre lots... for $20 an acre! </p>
            <h3>The name "Turlock" is commonly believed to derive from the Gaelic word "Turlough", meaning "dry lake".

            <figcaption>The two story addition built onto the side of the original Turlock Hotel was authorized by its
                new owner John J. Vignolo. He purchased it from Elizabeth E. Allen in 1904. The men sitting comfortably
                on the porch are either paying guests or local townsmen. To the far right below the Turlock Hotel sign a
                woman appears to be typing her horse's reins to the hitching rail. To the left of the sign is a tall
                pole with strung wires attached which may be telegraph or telephone wires. A sign stating the hotel to
                be a pubic telelphone station is visible in an earlier photograph of the Turlock Hotel. Note the horse
                watering trough at the base of the pole.</figcaption>
