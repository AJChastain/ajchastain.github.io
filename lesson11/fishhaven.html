            <h2>Things are Looking Fishy</h2>
            <h3>Spring forward with lots of fishing options</h3>
            <p><i>by Mike Demick, Staff Biologist, Idaho Department of Fish and Game<br>
            and Roger Phillips, Idaho Fish and Game public information specialist</i></p>
            <p>Press Release: Monday, March 7, 2016</p>
            <p>Many Idaho waters are open to fishing year round, so anglers can make the most of the year by focusing on
                times when fishing is at its best for certain waters.

                <br><br>For those who aren't shy about braving unpredictable weather in late winter and early spring, there are
                many places to catch fish, and a surprising variety of them. With daylight savings time starting March
                13, there's also enough time for after-work or after-school fishing trips to a local fishing spot.

                <br><br>Idaho Fish and Game stocks trout year round, but expands its operations as more waters open in March and
                become suitable for trout. Typically, ponds are the first places, followed by small lakes and
                reservoirs, then larger reservoirs and streams, but it depends on many factors.

                <br><br>This year, Idaho Fish and Game is stocking 1.6 million catchable rainbow trout between 10 and 12 inches,
                which are stocked strictly for anglers to catch. They are typically stocked where they are easily
                accessible to anglers and there's high probability they will get caught.

                <br><br>There are also lots of steelhead available in the spring, and Chinook salmon start arriving in Idaho in
                April. At some lower elevations, warmwater fishing gets started in March and typically improves as we
                get further into spring.

                <br><br><b>Tips for early season fishing</b>

                <br><br><b>Watch the weather: </b>Fishing is typically better when temperatures are warming and the barometer is
                stable. A temperature drop or a storm typically slows fishing.

                <br><br><b>Take it slow: </b>Fish can be sluggish in cold water. Air temperature warms much faster than water, so even
                on a warm, spring day, the water is probably chilly. Bait is a good option, and if you're using lures or
                flies, a slow retrieve usually works better.

                <br><br><b>Don't overlook warmwater fish:</b> They become active sooner than you might think, but expect subtle
                strikes, and the fish to be in different places than where you found them last summer. Bass fishing can
                be good. Catch rates tend to be low, but the biggest fish are often the first to become active. Smaller,
                shallower waters typically warm faster than larger bodies of water. Ponds and small reservoirs are good
                options. Same goes for shallow coves, bays and flats in larger lakes and reservoirs.

                <br><br><b>Get the latest information:</b> Check Fish and Game stocking reports at
                <a href="http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/public/fish/stocking/">fishandgame.idaho.gov/public/fish/stocking</a> for good places to catch rainbow trout and other
                fish.

                <br><br><b>Watch for hatches:</b> Fly anglers can find good early season bug hatches, which are typically chironomids
                (midges) or baetis (blue-wing olives). There are usually trout feeding on them.

                <br><br><b>Fish locally: </b>Especially if the weather forecast looks iffy. You don't want to drive several hours and
                then find unfavorable weather and water conditions. Spring is a good time of year to explore local ponds
                and reservoirs that you may have overlooked in the past.</p>
